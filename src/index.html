        <td><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment I</span> - This commandment is in direct opposition to The Constitution when we read,               “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the                   free exercise thereof;…”</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment II</span> - There is nothing that prohibits this in The Constitution.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment III</span> - “Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech.” You can say           what you want.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment IV</span> - This goes back to making no law reposting an establishment of religion</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment V</span> - Here is the follow up of this law in the Bible, “If a man have a stubborn              and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother             ... all the men of the city shall stone him with stones, that he die ….” (Dt. 21:18, 21) This             is definitely not endorsed. </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment VI</span> - This is applicable, but not unique to the 10 Commandments as this has                 typically been endorsed by multiple cultures and their laws. Also, exceptions were made if it was Isreal that was commanded to do the killing (Deuteronomy 20:16–17).</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment VII</span> - The                 Constitution does not address this at all. You have the right to make bad choices that are               against your own moral interests.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment VIII</span> - Same as above, it’s applicable but generally endorsed by multiple         cultures and laws. This is not unique to the 10 Commandments.</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandments IX</span> - In the sense of perjury this would be consistent with the laws of the land</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Commandment X</span> - There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits you acting against your better judgement.</p>
